- - Basic rules that we all have to observe in the office. Here are the laws.
  - 1. Turn off your cell phone ringing.
    2. Observe personal hygiene - make sure you get clean and neat.
    3. Take care of your own workplace - this is the responsibility of each of us.
    4. Keep hygiene in the office - clean up behind in the kitchens and in the halls. Keep the rest areas clean.
    5. Make sure your computers are locked before you get out of your desk.
    6. In order not to disturb the work of colleagues around you, hold personal and non-working conversations in the lounges or rest areas.
    7. Do not disturb your colleagues when you see that they are chatting right now - with another colleague or client - personally, by phone or by skype.
    8. Take care of ownership of the firm, that is, keep the equipment in your hands, observe the fire requirements - it is good for you!
    9. Do not come to work sick or sick. The risk of infecting colleagues and bringing them to their families is great. Better take a hospital or discuss the opportunities to work from home with your manager.
